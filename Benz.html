    <h1>Karl Benz</h1>
    <img src="./Karl-Benz-1920.jpeg" alt="">
    <p>Carl Friedrich Benz (German: [bɛnts] (audio speaker iconlisten); 25 November 1844 – 4 April 1929), sometimes also Karl Friedrich Benz, was a German engine designer and automotive engineer. His Benz Patent Motorcar from 1885 is considered the first practical automobile and first car put into series production.</p>
    <p>His company Benz & Cie., based in Mannheim, was the world's largest automobile plant of its day.[2] In 1926 it merged with Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft to form Daimler-Benz which produces the Mercedes-Benz among other brands.
    </p>
    <p>Benz is widely regarded as "the father of the car"[3][4] and "father of the automobile industry".[5]</p>
    <p>Carl Benz was born Karl Friedrich Michael Vaillant, on 25 November 1844 in Mühlburg, now a borough of Karlsruhe, Baden-Württemberg, which is part of modern Germany. His parents were Josephine Vaillant and a locomotive driver, Johann Georg Benz, whom she married a few months later. According to German law, the child acquired the name "Benz" by legal marriage of his parents.[6][7][8][9] When he was two years old, his father died of pneumonia,[10] and his name was changed to Karl Friedrich Benz in remembrance of his father.[11]</p>
    <p>Despite living in near poverty, his mother strove to give him a good education. Benz attended the local school in Karlsruhe and was a prodigious student. In 1853, at the age of nine, he started at the scientifically oriented Lyceum. Next he studied at Karlsruhe's polytechnical school under the instruction of Ferdinand Redtenbacher.</p>
    <p>Benz had originally focused his studies on locksmithing, but he eventually followed his father's steps toward locomotive engineering. On 30 September 1860, at age 15, he passed the entrance exam for mechanical engineering for the Karlsruhe polytechnical school, which he subsequently attended. Benz graduated 9 July 1864 aged 19.</p>
    <p>Following his formal education, Benz had seven years of professional training in several companies, but did not fit well in any of them. The training started in Karlsruhe with two years of varied jobs in a mechanical engineering company.</p>
    <p>He then moved to Mannheim to work as a draftsman and designer in a scales factory. In 1868 he went to Pforzheim to work for the bridge building company Gebrüder Benckiser Eisenwerke und Maschinenfabrik. Finally, he went to Vienna for a short period to work at an iron construction company.
    </p>
<p>In 1871, at the age of twenty-seven, Karl Benz joined August Ritter in launching the Iron Foundry and Mechanical Workshop in Mannheim, later renamed Factory for Machines for Sheet-metal Working.[12]</p>
<p>The enterprise's first year went very badly. Ritter turned out to be unreliable, and the business's tools were impounded. The difficulty was overcome when Benz's fiancée, Bertha Ringer, bought out Ritter's share in the company using her dowry.[12][13]
</p>
<p>On 20 July 1872,[14] Karl Benz and Bertha Ringer married. They had five children: Eugen (1873), Richard (1874), Clara (1877), Thilde (1882), and Ellen (1890).
</p>
<p>Despite the business misfortunes, Karl Benz led in the development of new engines in the early factory he and his wife owned. To get more revenue, in 1878 he began to work on new patents.</p>
<p>First, he concentrated on creating a reliable petrol two-stroke engine. Benz finished his two-stroke engine on 31 December 1879, and was granted a patent for it on 28 June 1880.
</p>
<p>Karl Benz showed his real genius, however, through his successive inventions registered while designing what would become the production standard for his two-stroke engine. Benz soon patented the speed regulation system, the ignition using sparks with battery, the spark plug, the carburetor, the clutch, the gear shift, and the water radiator.
</p>
<p>Problems arose again when the banks at Mannheim demanded that Bertha and Karl Benz's enterprise be incorporated due to the high production costs it maintained.</p>
<p>The Benzes were forced to improvise an association with photographer Emil Bühler and his brother (a cheese merchant), to get additional bank support.</p>
<p>became the joint-stock company Gasmotoren Fabrik Mannheim in 1882.
</p>
<p>After all the necessary incorporation agreements, Benz was unhappy because he was left with merely five percent of the shares and a modest position as director. Worst of all, his ideas weren't considered when designing new products, so he withdrew from that corporation just one year later, in 1883.
</p>
<p>Benz's lifelong hobby brought him to a bicycle repair shop in Mannheim owned by Max Rose and Friedrich Wilhelm Eßlinger. In 1883, the three founded a new company producing industrial machines: Benz & Companie Rheinische Gasmotoren-Fabrik, usually referred to as Benz & Cie. Quickly growing to twenty-five employees, it soon began to produce static gas engines as well.</p>
<p>The success of the company gave Benz the opportunity to indulge in his old passion of designing a horseless carriage. </p>
<p>Based on his experience with, and fondness for, bicycles, he used similar technology when he created an automobile.</p>
<p>It featured wire wheels (unlike carriages' wooden ones) [15] with a four-stroke engine of his own design between the rear wheels, with a very advanced coil ignition[16] and evaporative cooling rather than a radiator.[16] Power was transmitted by means of two roller chains to the rear axle.</p>
<p>Karl Benz finished his creation in 1885 and named it "Benz Patent-Motorwagen".</p>
